Of all the countless utilities available, this is the one I recommend that everyone starts practicing as soon as they can. Technically, I could probably better fit a section for setting up OpenSSH in Chapter 7, Setting Up Network Services, but this utility is very handy, and we should start using it as soon as possible. In this section, I'll give you some information on OpenSSH and how to install it, and then I'll finish up the section with a few examples of actually using it.")~~

[David Herron](https://subscription.packtpub.com/book/web_development/9781838987572/9 "Node.js is the leading choice of server-side web development platform, enabling developers to use the same tools and paradigms for both server-side and client-side software. This updated fifth edition of Node.js Web Development focuses on the new features of Node.js 14, Express 4.x, and ECMAScript, taking you through modern concepts, techniques, and best practices for using Node.js.  
The book starts by helping you get to grips with the concepts of building server-side web apps with Node.js. You’ll learn how to develop a complete Node.js web app, with a backend database tier to help you explore several databases. You'll deploy the app to real web servers, including a cloud hosting platform built on AWS EC2 using Terraform and Docker Swarm, while integrating other tools such as Redis and NGINX. As you advance, you'll learn about unit and functional testing, along with deploying test infrastructure using Docker. Finally, you'll discover how to harden Node.js app security, use Let's Encrypt to provision the HTTPS service, and implement several forms of app security with the help of expert practices. With each chapter, the book will help you put your knowledge into practice throughout the entire life cycle of developing a web app.  
By the end of this Node.js book, you’ll have gained practical Node.js web development knowledge and be able to build and deploy your own apps on a public web hosting solution.")
